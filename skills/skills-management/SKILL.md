# skills-management

Keep source authoring, generated mirrors, and runtime installations distinct. Use the configured canonical library; installed copies are not editable sources.

1. Search before creating. Download the complete current skill and relevant references. Compare consumers and installed copies before diagnosing drift. Read [source prerequisites](references/prerequisites.md).
2. Follow the requested branch: [creation and authoring](references/creation.md), [updates](references/updating.md), or [rename and removal](references/management.md). Preserve clear trigger boundaries, safety constraints, source attribution, and required assets.
3. Validate structure and behavior separately. Read [quality checks](references/quality-checks.md) for descriptions, progressive disclosure, routing cases, and evidence standards.
4. Publish to the canonical source only within authorization. Download again and compare the full body and file set; review normalization rather than assuming upload success proves fidelity.
5. Refresh only approved installations and mirrors using their actual adapter: [filesystem installation](references/capy-installation.md) or [repository distribution](references/github-cli.md). These adapter references contain necessary platform details; load only the applicable one. For failure or legacy copies, use [recovery](references/migration-troubleshooting.md).

Keep mutable IDs, accounts, model choices, credentials, and destinations in runtime configuration. Preserve one rule owner and route to capabilities rather than copying neighboring procedures. Do not infer deletion or public-sharing permission from a rename or refresh.

Finish when canonical exports match the intended change, approved installations are verified, superseded names no longer route, and mirror state is known. Report remaining gaps and distinguish static checks, scenario evaluation, and live execution. Existing sessions may retain an earlier skill registry.
