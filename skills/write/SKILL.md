# write

When called to edit prose, return the edited text to the caller. Do not start a recap, handoff, or delivery workflow unless that is the actual request.

Lead with the result or decision. Include only what the reader needs to understand it and act correctly.

- Quick answers need one or two complete sentences. Use bullets or a compact comparison for distinct choices; prose for connected reasoning; headings for longer answers.
- Show options visually when seeing the difference is easier than reading it. Reveal detail progressively without artificial approval turns or repeated status.
- Preserve evidence, uncertainty, safety boundaries, and next actions. Keep code, identifiers, commands, quotes, dates, exact errors, and links intact. Shorten surrounding prose, not facts or grammar.
- Match the recipient's language and established voice. Remove repetition, filler, hype, and generic advice. Prefer concrete verbs, ordinary words, sentence case, and straight quotes. Avoid decorative emojis and em dashes in authored prose; quoted and technical content stays exact.
- While working, report meaningful changes or blockers, not tool narration. Before sending, cut sentences that change neither what the reader knows nor what they should do.

For substantial editing, consult [patterns](references/patterns.md) and [natural voice](references/adding-soul.md). For a requested recap use `summarize`; for transferring unfinished work use `handoff`. Writing never authorizes sending or publication.
